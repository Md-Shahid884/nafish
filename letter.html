            <p>I hope you’re well in the hospital! I was really sad to hear about your fracture while playing at school. We all miss you a lot.
                I wanted to share some good news. We had a fun day at school yesterday! Everyone made a big card for you, and we all wrote messages and drew pictures. You’ll love it!
                Also, we started a new game during recess, and it’s super fun! I can’t wait to tell you all about it when you’re back.
                
                Get well soon! We’re all looking forward to having you back with us.</p>
